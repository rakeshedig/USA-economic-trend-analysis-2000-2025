# USA-economic-trend-analysis-2000-2025
Performed ELT and EDA on 25 years of U.S. economic data to analyze the impact of interest rates on loan defaults and consumer spending. Used Python to create dual-axis trend charts and compute correlations. Found that macroeconomic shocks (e.g., 2008, COVID-19) had greater impact than rate changes.
