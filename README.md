# 📊 Effect of Changes in Interest Rates on Consumer Spending & Loan Defaults in USA| Python, Pandas, Matplotlib (2000–2025)

This project analyzes how changes in interest rates have influenced U.S. loan default rates and consumer spending trends over the past 25 years.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Data Sources
- **Interest Rates**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **Loan Defaults**: FRED (DRALACBN)
- **Consumer Spending (PCE)**: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

## 🧪 Methodology
- Performed ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) using Pandas
- Conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Created dual-axis trend plots and computed correlation coefficients

## 📌 Key Findings
- Moderate negative correlation (-0.43) between interest rates and loan defaults
- Consumer spending increased steadily, even during interest rate hikes
- Events like the 2008 crisis and COVID-19 had significant economic influence

## ✅ Conclusion
Interest rates alone don't fully explain trends in loan defaults or consumer spending. Macroeconomic shocks, stimulus policies, and job conditions also play critical roles.
